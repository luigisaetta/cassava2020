###  This repository contains the work I've done during the Kaggle Cassava2020 competition

* November 2020

The things I have experimented with success:

* using PyTorch instead of TF
* Albumentations for Image preprocessing and augmentation
* jpeg4py for faster loading
* One cycle learning rate
* integration with **MLFlow** for run's metrics tracking
